“Thanks, Pa,” I called back with a grin.
After a period of silence, my phone suddenly filled with messages—greetings asking where I had been, how I was, and expressing concern about my absence. It warmed my heart to realize that
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
there were people who genuinely cared about my existence. I began responding to everyone, and among the messages was one that stood out—a special message from Ankita, my childhood friend. She had been one of my closest female friends during those days, and reading her message filled me with nostalgia. Ankita was now living in Australia, and our conversation brought back a flood of memories. As I was engrossed in reminiscing and replying to her, my grandmother called out,
"Jiu, come have dinner."
I couldn’t resist the invitation. Setting my phone aside, I eagerly made my way to the dining area. The aroma of the food was heavenly, and today she had prepared all my favorite dishes. I took my seat and savored every bite, feeling as though I had not eaten something this satisfying in ages. While I was enjoying the meal, I faintly heard a sound coming from my room. It resembled the ringtone of my phone, but I dismissed it as a figment of my imagination, too absorbed in the delightful experience of the food. As I finished my dinner, a thought lingered in my mind—what if I could enjoy such meals every day? I resolved that I had to do something about it.
(AFTER HAVING DINNER)
After a long, tiring day, the only word that escaped my lips was "relief." It was going to be a stress-free night for the first time in a while. As I returned to my room, I checked my emails, but something made me uneasy. There were two missed calls from an unknown number. I immediately searched it on Truecaller, and to my shock, it was the HR department. A wave of regret washed over me for not having my phone with me earlier. Conflicted, I pondered my next move—should I return the call right away or wait? After much deliberation, I decided to make the call. After all, I hadn't done anything wrong.
As the phone rang, my heartbeat quickened. "Why isn’t he answering?" I thought anxiously. Just then, I heard a voice on the other end. "Yes, hello."
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Hello, sir, this is Jiya. I missed your call earlier while I was having dinner. I apologize for the inconvenience," I replied nervously, immediately wondering if I had over-apologized.
"It's alright, Jiya. I understand," he said, his tone unexpectedly gentle. "I called to discuss your tasks and your joining details." This surprised me, as he had been quite stern during the interview.
"When should I report for duty, sir?" I asked.
"I’ve already sent an email with the rules and regulations. Just keep one thing in mind—respect your job and your colleagues, and we’ll always be here to support you. Understood?"
I was still taken aback by his polite demeanor, wondering if this was the same HR I had encountered during the interview. "Y-yes, sir. I will do my best to make you proud," I replied, perhaps laying it on a bit thick this time.
"Alright, we'll see you soon. By the way, you’ll be joining the board group, so tread carefully," he said.
"Of course, sir. No worries," I replied, ending the call after wishing him a good night. As soon as the call disconnected, I let out a deep breath. "Phew, that was intense."
I opened the email he had mentioned and, to my surprise, it was much more relaxed than I had anticipated. The work environment seemed cheerful and easygoing, though I still needed to prepare. That meant shopping for new clothes. I scrolled through Amazon, Myntra, and Ajio, ordering 20 pairs of Kurtis—traditional attire I adore. Of course, I knew not all of them would fit or suit me, so I planned to return the ones that didn’t. Smart shopping, as they say! Still, I knew I had to visit physical stores to make sure I was fully prepared.
As I was browsing through my Kindle, grandpa walked in and asked, "Jiya, when do you start your job?"
"Day after tomorrow, I think. Why?" I replied.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Just curious. I wanted to talk to you about something," he said with a smile. That simple sentence was enough to know what was coming next. Ever since I was a child, my grandfather had a tradition of giving me life lessons before any significant event. His wisdom has been the ladder to my success, and I often wonder—what if these words had come from my father instead? What if he had been the one to teach me how to charge forward without ever looking back?
I was about to go to sleep when my phone suddenly beeped—it was an Instagram notification. A message appeared from someone I didn’t have the best relationship with, saying, "How are you?" Although I recognized him, I pretended not to. I responded, "Who is this?" To which he replied, "Oh, have you forgotten me?" I answered sharply, "Why should I remember you? You're not my boyfriend that I would need to."
I didn’t want to let him off so easily; I intended to make him regret messaging me. However, his response surprised me—he went silent. Was I too rude? Did I come across as having too much attitude? But before I could think more, he simply replied, "Good night, duster."
"Duster" was a nickname given to me by a group of boys who used to throw dusters at me, teasing me endlessly. I didn’t return his goodnight and just responded with, "What?" He went offline shortly after, leaving me frustrated and confused.
I was filled with frustration, wondering how he could behave like this. It was me who wanted to make him feel regret. In my agitation, I called Kabya to ask if she would join me for a jog in the morning.
"Hey, are you coming jogging tomorrow?" I asked.
"Oh yes, I have to! Raghav called me 'moto' today," she replied. Raghavt, her long-time boyfriend and school friend, had a solid and enduring relationship with her. I couldn’t help but feel a pang of amazement at how lucky they were together.
"What? Haha!" I burst out laughing.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Don’t laugh, yaar! He’s so silly. He loves my chubby cheeks but doesn’t want my unhealthy fat. How is that even possible? How can I do both at the same time?"
Raghav really was a gentleman. He never pressured her about anything. I admired how he would subtly influence Kavya’s decisions, especially when it came to her wardrobe choices. Whenever she wore something revealing while out with him, he would casually compliment other girls who were dressed more traditionally. This always made Kavya a little jealous, and soon enough, she began to opt for traditional attire. It wasn’t that Raghav had a particular preference for traditional clothing; he simply understood the reality of modern boys and the mindset of the generation.
That night, I set my alarm and tried to sleep, though excitement kept me awake. I couldn’t stop thinking about the lessons my grandfather would impart the next day. I found myself guessing what he might teach—perhaps something about handling distractions, or maybe advice about college, or how to cultivate the right attitude towards people. My mind raced with possibilities.
(IN THE MORNING)
I couldn't believe it—I had just covered a distance of 20 kilometers. I glanced at my smartwatch, impressed by the achievement, though I was breathing heavily, with my heart rate soaring to 125 beats per minute. My clothes were drenched in sweat, but I had successfully broken my personal record. As anticipated, Kavya was probably still asleep. Despite several attempts, she hadn’t answered any of my calls.
By the time I returned home, it was too late to take my usual morning bath. Just as I was about to enter, my phone rang—it was Kavya.
"Hey, where are you? What happened to your morning jog?" I asked in a teasing tone.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"You won’t believe what I'm about to tell you," she replied, sounding both amused and slightly embarrassed. "I set an alarm for 4 o'clock, but I accidentally set it for 4 PM instead of 4 AM!"
I couldn’t help but burst out laughing at the absurdity of the situation.
"You must be thinking about Raghav, that's why you forgot such a simple thing," I said.
"Maybe," she replied, ", but please don't mention this to him if you happen to cross paths with him. He already thinks I'm foolish, and if he finds out about this, he will tease me endlessly."
"Alright, alright, don't worry. I won't say a word," I reassured her.
After finishing my conversation with Kāvya, I took my morning bath. By the time I was done, Grandma had breakfast ready. As always, it was delicious. Watching my grandmother's joyful, smiling face, I found myself in a perplexing dilemma. How could life be so perfect? Everything was unfolding exactly as I wished, without a trace of worry or tension, I thought to myself. Being someone prone to overthinking, it was unusual for things to be going so smoothly. Deep down, I knew that God was probably preparing me for some great challenge. My relationship with Him was beyond words. We often conversed, discussing the nature of humans. He seemed to delight in placing me in difficult situations, only to rescue me later. Despite it all, I couldn't help but feel affection for Him. I love You, God.
Just then, the doorbell rang. I was surprised to receive a delivery so early in the morning. It was the clothes I had ordered the previous day. I tried each of them on, and to my astonishment, they all fit perfectly. Though the clothes were good, I still felt a sense of dissatisfaction.
(AFTER HAVING LUNCH)
I was feeling quite nervous, though I wasn’t sure why. I think the uncertainty about the source of my nervousness made me even more anxious. It wasn’t due to a lack of confidence, and it wasn’t
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
because this was my first job—I’ve done many internships at reputable companies. But this was my first actual job in a higher position, and I would be working under Ritik, one of my biggest rivals. I never expected to encounter him like this.
Did he win? He used to challenge me in everything, and now I’d be working under him. It feels strange, maybe even humiliating. Could Ritik be the reason for my nervousness? He looked so handsome now, which was different from how I remembered him in school. Time changes everything—appearance, behavior, everything. I sincerely hope Kavya was mistaken, and that Ritik does not have feelings for me. If her words prove true, working with him would be difficult. Please, God, let him have a girlfriend. Actually, I’m pretty sure he has one. Ritik was always a man of his word, humble, and a natural leader back in the day. But he could never defeat me, and I know guys like him have a strong sense of male pride.
I remember him saying that if he ever chose a girl, she would be the one he’d stay with for life, and that the girl would be incredibly lucky. He was kind to everyone except me. His voice was deep and commanding, like thunder. When he spoke, you just wanted to listen. But with me, his tone was always harsh and ruthless.
"Why am I even thinking about him?" I thought to myself, trying to shake off the thoughts before taking a short nap.
(A CALL FROM PA)
“Yes, pa?” I answered, still half-asleep as he called in the middle of my nap.
“Where are you?” he asked.
“Home. Why? Where are you? I haven’t seen you since morning.” I was curious because he had been gone for a while. I asked Grandma about him earlier, and she said it was supposed to be a surprise for me.
“Oh, I’m out to buy something for you. Can you join me?” he said.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
“I can, but what are you going to buy? I already have everything I need,” I replied.
“Nothing special, just come along,” he insisted.
“Okay, fine. Send me your location.”
He was at the city center. But why? I got dressed in a white kurta and blue jeans. Then I went to the kitchen to let Grandma know. “Hey, Bubu, Grandpa called me to join him. By the way, what’s he doing in the city center?”
She was busy with some household chores. She’s not the type to sit idle and rest. As soon as she saw me, her eyes lit up like the moon, and she rushed over to put a kala tika behind my ear to ward off the evil eye. “Oh, where did this Cinderella come from?” she teased, making me blush. She looked at me with so much affection.
I booked a cab and headed to the city center.
As I entered the cab, a wave of negativity seemed to engulf me, likely due to the unsettling news I had been hearing recently. The continuous stream of distressing reports had affected my mood, leaving me feeling uneasy.
"Ma'am! Ma'am!"
"What?" I responded, startled from my thoughts.
"Your OTP, ma'am," the driver reminded me. I had been so lost in my reflections that I had almost forgotten. At that moment, my grandmother's words echoed in my mind. She used to tell me that I should have someone I trust—perhaps a close male friend or a boyfriend. I always replied that I didn’t trust anyone, having encountered several betrayals from those I once considered gentlemen, but who turned out not to be. However, in moments like this, I realize the importance of having someone to rely on. If I had a trustworthy male friend or boyfriend, I might have felt more at ease traveling, without the anxiety weighing me down.
I shared my live location with my grandfather and messaged him to let him know I had taken a cab. Despite my love for cars, I hadn’t
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
purchased one yet—not because of financial constraints, but out of concern for my grandfather’s worries about the reckless driving in the city. But I have decided that I will buy one this month—an expensive one.
As I peered through the car window, I saw protests unfolding over a rape case that had occurred the day before. The situation was intense, but I couldn’t help but think that it would all be in vain. This is India, after all. The outcry will likely burn bright for a week, and then, as always, it will fade away.
While the crowd was shouting, I reminded myself that not everyone is the same. There are true gentlemen like Raghav and others, though they are rare, like gems. As we arrived in the city center, I realized that I hadn't been bored, thanks to my own thoughts—I'm proud to be an overthinker.
(AFTER ARIVING)
"Hey Grandpa, where are you?" I asked.
"Come to Tanishq on the second floor," he replied.
I was puzzled. Why was he at a jewelry store? Surely, he knew I had no interest in jewelry. Was he there for Bubu, perhaps? The atmosphere at the City Centre was its usual bustling self. People often came here, not just to shop, but to escape their stress, to fill the void with loneliness. Couples were scattered around, enjoying each other's company, living what appeared to be peaceful, happy lives. But I knew better. Whenever I see someone, I can’t help but think of them as a book, where an author pours out emotions—joy, sorrow, and everything in between—onto its pages.
I opened the door and entered the shop, and to my shock, I saw Grandpa surrounded by open jewelry boxes. Every staff member looked exasperated. When he noticed me, he asked me to sit down. I was confused.
"But Grandpa, you know I don’t like jewelry, right? So why are we here?" I whispered to him.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"It’s not about what you need; it’s our responsibility as your guardians. If we don’t do this, your parents would have. That’s why," he explained.
"Okay, but why now? We still have plenty of time to take care of these things," I replied.
"There’s no certainty in life. What if we’re not around..." he began, but I quickly covered his mouth.
"Okay, okay, please don’t say that," I interrupted. I knew nothing was permanent, but I couldn’t bear to imagine a future without him. After losing my parents, I was traumatized, and I’ve since learned to prepare for the worst. But this was a thought I couldn’t entertain.
"Alright, now look at the jewelry and pick what you like. I’ve already removed the price tags so you won’t worry," Grandpa said.
Being a commerce student, I knew the importance of price, and he knew that I’d check. It took nearly four hours to choose everything, not because of me, but because Grandpa was insistent on getting me things I didn’t need but knew were blessings. Somehow, I caught a glimpse of the bill he was trying to hide from me. My heart nearly stopped—it was 97 lakhs, almost a crore. I knew he had savings because I managed both his personal and business accounts as his CA.
We made our way to the cafeteria, selected a cozy table, and ordered two cups of coffee.
"Did you see all the jewelry in the store today, Jiu?" Grandpa asked.
"Yes, almost all. Why?" I replied.
"Good, because we’re not coming back here next time for your wedding jewelry," he said, and I immediately understood what he meant.
"Grandpa, forget about the wedding. Why buy more jewelry? Isn’t this enough?" I asked, concerned.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"These are just formalities, but wedding gifts are different. And remember, you’re our only one. We want to see you settled, and I want to dance like crazy at your wedding. I promise I won’t cry," he said with a smile.
"I know you will, just a little," I teased.
"But Grandpa, I don’t trust anyone, and I’ve never made any close friends. How could I?" I asked, feeling uneasy about the future.
"Don’t worry, God will make sure you meet the right person, someone who’s meant for you," he reassured me.
It sounded like a dream, but I had too many other things to focus on in my life to dwell on that. "I don’t think so. Why don’t you find someone for me, Grandpa?" I asked, surprising myself with the question.
"Well, Jiu, this generation is different. I’m experienced, but I admit I don’t quite understand it. You know your generation better than I do, so I trust you’ll make the right choice," he said with confidence.
He was right—this generation seems to be losing itself, wasting countless hours scrolling through their phones and reels. As I sipped my coffee, my eyes wandered toward the small bookstall visible from our table in the cafeteria. Unsurprisingly, only two girls and one boy browsed the shelves, while on the other side, a long line formed at the game zone, with boys making up most of the crowd. It made me wonder why so many people, especially young men, are becoming so distracted and disconnected. I kept these thoughts, along with my joys and sorrows, locked within my books and me.
"Pa, you said you had something to discuss with me?" I asked, breaking the silence.
" Not now," he replied. "I’ll tell you when the time is right”.
“Okay," I nodded.
We had just finished our coffee when Grandpa mentioned he wanted to buy some clothes for me. I wasn’t particularly keen on
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
the idea, but Pa was insistent on dressing me in something of his own choice.
" Alright," he said, his tone playful, "do you want to look like an employee or a boss?".
" Honestly, I’m not sure," I replied, smiling. "But obviously, the boss, Pa."
“That’s my girl," he said, grinning with approval.
He has a great sense of style, but it wasn’t entirely his own. I’ve heard countless stories from my uncle about how Grandma was the one with a true eye for fashion, and her influence on Pa was undeniable. My uncle, by the way, played a major role in bringing Pa and Grandma together, a love story I’ve heard many times over.
"Okay, try this one," Pa said, handing me a beautiful dress. AT first glance, it appeared to be a Western-style outfit, but it was actually a Korean vintage edition.A white or cream-colored blouse with long sleeves. It has a soft, slightly formal look with delicate details and High-waisted, wide-leg trousers in a pastel shade (likely lavender or light purple) with a belt tied at the waist.
It was stunning—and expensive. I took it to the fitting room, and once I tried it on, I couldn’t help but admire how good it looked on me. I had mostly seen myself in traditional attire, so this was a refreshing change. When I stepped out to show Pa, his face lit up with amazement. His eyes, though silent, spoke volumes. Clothing like a book cover, enhances what’s inside. Even if the content is brilliant, a beautiful cover draws people in. Pa wanted more dresses like this one, with different color combinations, but unfortunately, they didn’t have anymore in stock. If I wanted more, I’d have to go through tailoring.
" How long will it take for delivery?" Pa asked the staff.
" We offer free home delivery," the staff member replied. "Just provide your measurements, and it will be delivered within two days.”
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
Though I wasn’t particularly excited, Pa was overjoyed, almost bouncing like a child. It made him so happy to do all of this for me. The expenses were substantial, and as a commerce student, the thought of it haunted me a bit. Still, I gave my measurements—34-25-35—and went along with it.
Though I thought the day had come to an end, without saying a word, he suddenly entered Zara.
"Why? What now?" I asked.
"Do you have handbags suitable for the office?" he inquired.
"No,".
He turned to me and said, "You should have some. If you want to present yourself like a boss, it's important to look the part because our eyes reveal everything about a person."
Although we both knew the saying, "don't judge a book by its cover," in that moment, it felt like a falsehood.
He proceeded to purchase five bags in different colors. "Why five?" I asked, surprised.
"One for each day of the workweek, so you can have a fresh style every day," he replied. He knew such things well, being the head of his own company.
"Are we done now? We should head home. It's getting late," I said, feeling the weight of the evening. It was already 7 PM, and tomorrow would be my first day at the new job. I couldn't afford to be late. The day had passed quickly, filled with the hustle and bustle of our errands. The air in the mall was infused with the tempting aroma of PVR popcorn, adding to the whirlwind atmosphere. I glanced over at Grandpa, who wore a wide smile as he paid the bills. Just earlier, he had covered my school fees, but this felt different. There was an underlying sense of tension. I felt a bit anxious, even though everything seemed fine on the surface. We gathered our shopping bags, and as usual, Grandpa didn't let me carry any of them—always the protective figure.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Shall I book a cab?" I asked.
"Go ahead. I'll catch up after paying the bill," he replied.
Tired and craving my bed, I made my way to the first floor, where the cab was waiting. I called the cab driver to inquire about his exact location.
"Ritik!”. It was a moment where I froze, completely still, like a statue.
I turned around and was shocked to see Ankita. It was an intense moment for me. Few steps ahead of her, there was my favourite rival.
What was he doing here? My jaw dropped slightly as I took his appearance. Was it really him? Kavya had been right—he looked completely different. Whether it was from going to the gym or some other change, he had transformed. Even his height had increased. The last time I saw him, she was around 5’6”, but now he stood at about 5'10" or 5'11", dressed sharply in a formal blue coat and pant, looking quite sophisticated and sexy too. They exchanged laughter upon seeing each other, the kind that suggested they were reuniting after years apart.
“Hello! Hello!”.
“Yes?”
“I am waiting at the back entrance maam?”.
“Ohk wait”.
Just then, Grandpa rejoined me, jolting me from my thoughts.
"What’s wrong?" he asked.
"Nothing," I replied quickly.
We made our way to the back entrance where our car awaited, but my mind was still fixated on him, but why? Was there something between them? I remembered how Ritik had treated her like an
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
elder sister back in the day, but something seemed to have changed. Should I message her? But why would I? I couldn’t quite figure out why this was bothering me so much.
(AFTER TACKING THE CAB)
"By the way, Jiyu!"
"Yes, Pa?"
"Who did you see at the mall?" He caught me.
"What!"
"Yes, who?"
I never lie to him, and I always share everything with him.
"Actually, Pa, it's a long story. I'll tell you later. But in short, I saw my biggest rival."
"Oh, okay. But why were you so surprised to see her?"
"Not her, Pa, it was him. And he's the Managing Director of the company I'm going to join tomorrow."
"What! Ha ha ha," he burst into laughter. "It's not funny, Pa." "It is, Jiyu. It means you've lost the race."
Is he right? I got lost in my thoughts. Did I really lose? "Hey, Jiyu, it's alright. I know you've never lost in your life, but that's life. There will be moments when you have to pause."
I knew he was just trying to comfort me, but deep down, all I wanted was to beat him in this race. And I know I will.
I was quietly planning my day for tomorrow in my mind. "Jiu, do you know why these rivals are important to us?". "Why?" I asked. "Because they give us a reason to improve ourselves." He was right. I remembered the hard-working nights back in my school days. I always gave my best to be first and never let him get close to my position. So, grandpa was right after all.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
(AFTER REACHING HOME)
I was completely exhausted. All I wanted was my cozy bed. I can work for days without sleep, but this shopping had drained me. I quietly opened the door and suddenly,
"Boom!" "Congratulations, Jiya!"
There stood my uncle, aunty, some of my intern colleagues, and Kavya, all smiling and cheering. I hadn’t expected this at all.
"Hey, what’s this?" I asked.
"Can’t you see?" Kavya teased.
"I know, but why?"
"What do you mean, why?" she laughed.
"You should be the one throwing us a party, but here we are, celebrating for you!" I was genuinely surprised.
Grandma knows I love surprises, and this one completely revived my tired body.
"Who planned all this?" I asked.
"Me and your Bubu," Kavya said.
The decorations were stunning, and it looked like they had spent a lot on everything. A table full of food and a huge cake sat in the middle of the room.
"So, how is it?" Kavya asked.
"Just like you—awesome!" I replied.
"But how did you and Bubu manage all this?" I was amazed by the setup. The large size of my hall gave them plenty of space for the decorations and lighting, making it look more like a five-star restaurant than my house.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Are you crazy? Do you really think we did all this by ourselves?" Kavya laughed.
"Oh, I get it. You hired a decoration team, right?"
"No."
"Then who did it?"
"That’s actually a secret," she smiled.
"What the heck, yaar!" I exclaimed.
"Sorry, I promised I wouldn’t tell," she said.
I knew it was pointless to ask her further—she’s too good at keeping secrets.
"Fine," I sighed. "Let’s eat something now. I’m so tired and starving!"
"Sure," she agreed, and we headed towards the dining area.
Everyone was laughing and chatting about me, but I wasn’t feeling that excited. It was just a job, after all, even though it was a high-paying and prestigious one, being ranked among the top 10 in Asia. Various voices chimed in with different remarks.
"Hey, Jiya’s Pa, it’s time to get her married, so when is it happening?"
"Be careful now, make sure she has good friends to protect her."
"She’s not a little girl anymore."
"She’s beautiful, intelligent, smart, kind, humble— a perfect girl from a family like yours. You must be careful when choosing someone for her."
Their words were so kind, and the hustle and bustle in my flat seemed pointless. After a long time, I experienced such an environment, actually, it was the first time in my flat.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Shall we cut the cake now?" Grandpa asked.
I cut the cake, though it felt a bit childish, but after all, I was still a little kid in their eyes. Everyone had gifts for me, along with their good wishes. We had dinner, and soon, everyone headed home. Kavya was going to stay with me tonight since it was already quite late. Both of us were tired, and I was still puzzled about who had arranged everything. Suddenly, Bubu came to mind, but I didn’t want to ask her now—she was too tired and not in the mood for it.
Kavya and I washed the dishes and cleaned the hall, but I didn’t want to disturb the beautiful decorations. I just kept admiring the atmosphere it created. We tied our aprons and went to the kitchen, where it felt like a mini war—over 50 dishes waiting to be cleaned.
"Okay, let’s divide the work," I said.
"Sure, you do half, and I’ll handle the rest," Kavya replied.
"Fine. And the hall?"
"Don’t touch the hall, we’ll just clean the floor."
"Agreed."
In the kitchen, we were behaving like housewives competing over chores. It was already 1 AM, and I knew I was going to mess up my day tomorrow. Somehow, we finished all the work and finally went to bed. I collapsed onto my cozy bed when Grandma called,
"Jiu, are you still awake?"
"Yes, why? Do you need something?" I asked.
"No, but I want to tell you something."
"Sure," I said, getting up from bed and stepping out of the room.
"A boy and a girl came today while you were out with Grandpa and did all the decorations," she said.
"What? You don’t know them?"
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"No, but they knew you," she replied.
"How did they get the address? And why did you let them in?" I asked, surprised.
"They came with Kavya, and she said they were planning a surprise for you," Grandma explained.
I was completely confused, and half my sleep was gone.
"Do you know their names?" I asked.
"The girl’s name was Ankita, but the boy didn’t reveal his name. When I asked Kavya, she kept changing the topic."
Why did they come here, and who was the boy? Why didn’t Ankita tell me about this, and why wasn’t they with us during the celebration?
"Okay, fine. By the way, what was he wearing?" I don’t know why, but my heart pushed me to ask.
"I think he was in a blue coat and pants, with a white shirt," Grandma replied.
It was Ritick. Fuck. She continued,
"He was handsome, and his voice was rough, but he did everything, including buying the cake for you. He didn’t even drink a glass of water, and he was very polite with me, like he knew me well."
At that moment, I wanted to kill Kavya, but then I remembered she’s the only child in her family.
I went to my bedroom, switched on the lights, and looked at Kavya with my angry eyes—I really wanted to kill her! But there she was, lying on the bed like a little kid. She had done so much today, so I didn’t disturb her. But one thing was certain: I wasn’t going to sleep tonight. Suddenly, I remembered I hadn’t chosen my outfit for tomorrow. I took out all the clothes I had ordered, but my mind kept going back to Grandpa’s dress. Without thinking too much, I ironed it a little and carefully placed it in the wardrobe.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
Despite the long, stressful day, my mind was still stuck in the shopping mall, filled with questions. What were those two doing there? Why did they come to my flat to give me a surprise, but not join us for the celebration? And then, I realized something important:
“Why am I even bothering with these thoughts? Tomorrow is special, yaar. Just chill.”
It was already 3 AM. The night felt endless, like the night before board exams, before a wedding, or before a heist.
Should I message him? Should I ask him why he did all this? I picked up my phone and opened Instagram. Oh, Fuck—he was still online. I put my phone aside and sat on the sofa, not thinking about anyone else, but only him. What a mysterious person, yaar. Maybe he’s trying to tell me, "You lost, Jiya." I just didn’t have the courage to message him or ask him about all this. But i will defeat him, for sure. I will.

"Hey, you did this, right?" Ankita called out to me while I was in a meeting with our board of directors.
"What do you mean?" I asked. I knew exactly what she was talking about, but I pretended not to. The sound of her voice confirmed that finally I did it! – something I had worked hard for, something that was my dream.
"Oh, my dear innocent brother, tell me the truth, or else I'll ask Kunal."
Kunal was her college friend and mine as well. We had met during our graduation days, and soon, the two of them were about to become a couple. Their chemistry was intense, as they argued frequently. And Ankita! She was like a ticking time bomb without a timer—she could explode at any moment, anywhere, and at any time, just like Jiya, but she looks ahhh when she got angry, her nose ufff.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Okay, I will call you in a while," I said, forgetting for a moment that I was in a meeting—again!
"Sir, could you please give us the presentation?" Rocky asked me.
As the Managing Director of the company, I had major responsibilities, and, surprisingly, I sometimes enjoyed the stress that came with them. I gave my best during the presentation, and it turned out to be another success for the team. However, I felt a bit nervous seeing the eager faces of my team members waiting for the treat. I was also waiting for a call from Raj. To distract myself, I went to the cafeteria for a strong coffee, all the while checking my phone constantly.
"Did you get the contract?" asked Alen, the guy making the coffee. Alen was one of the closest people in my life—genuine and humble. Actually, not just that; he was a perfect human being with all the qualities a person should have.
"Yes, Alen, I got it," I replied with a smile.
"Same as always, Ritik," he answered, smiling back.
I was still glancing at my phone, deciding that it was time to answer some of my pending DMs. "Here’s your strong coffee, Ritik," Alen said, handing me my cup. He always knew what I needed, especially during stressful something sweet and in this kind of situation a strong one. "Thanks, bro," I said.
But sometimes, I had this fear of losing Alen. It’s a strange fear because I’d already lost so many people whom I loved and considered special. Even today, I still don’t understand why they left me.
Suddenly, a memory from 15 years ago popped into my mind, and the coffee mug slipped from my hand while i was cheking instagram.
"What happened?" Alen asked.
"She’s online," I whispered.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
Alen took my phone and simply said, "What the hell!" My heart started racing, and I felt a rush of excitement mixed with nervousness. "Calm down, calm down," I muttered to myself, but I was shivering with nerves.
"She’s posted a story," Alen said.
"God, you’re awesome! Do you want to kill me today?" I thought, laughing at myself for overreacting. Should I see it? My heart was pounding loudly. "No, no, no," I told myself, but my stubborn, broken heart pushed me to click on her story.
There it was— "Hey Allen, have you ever seen the moon from so close?" I asked him while showing him her picture.
I was happy to see my "moon" shining, but now it’s too late. This was my last responsibility as a lover. I just needed to say sorry one last time, and then it would all end. My mind was filled with thoughts—I could do anything, yet I still couldn’t bring myself to do it. "It means everything will be alright now," I thought. I understand the hope he had for me—not only him, but Ankita and everyone else who knew about my feelings. They all believed everything would fall into place, but sometimes, you just have to accept the truth and move on. It’s been 15 years, and I don’t even know if I truly love Jiya anymore. I smiled and told him, "I think not. I’ve moved on, Allen. Now, all I want is my mental peace and my bike to travel."
He replied, "Listen, my dear Majnu, you have more than 100 bikes, even the most expensive ones. But you don’t have anyone to rest your head on for comfort." He was right, but… I loved traveling because it brought me healing. Every minute spent traveling made me a better person. When I was disturbed and broken, traveling revived me. It became the tears of my sorrow without actually making my eyes wet.
"Then what about the dreams you dreamed?" Allen asked.
"She was my dream, and I was in a deep sleep. Now, I’m awake, and this is the right time," I replied, trying to comfort myself.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
My hands were shaking in the biting cold, but my ears were burning—so hot that it felt like you could cook an omelet on them. I never imagined I’d end up in such a terrible situation in my life. The urge to message her, to ask about her, was driving me crazy. My fingers seemed to type on their own, "How are you?" My tongue wanted to say, "Send it," but my mind finally pressed the button. Within five seconds, it was "seen just now," and within fifteen seconds, a short reply appeared. It wasn’t what I had expected.
I didn’t know whether to collapse to the ground or bury myself under the soil, but I’d trained myself to control my nerves. Her reply was, "Who is this?" Really? She didn’t even recognize me. How could she do this to me? Did all my efforts mean nothing? But deep down, I hadn’t expected her to recognize me, so I didn’t feel hurt. Life without expectations is truly peaceful and beautiful; it changes you, and it makes life easier. But the truth is, we feel hurt even when we have no expectations. That’s just human psychology.
Why did I have to be human, God? What if I were air—a symbol of freedom and life for all living beings? Air has no expectations. It just flows and flows, uncaged and limitless, like a bird without boundaries, without end. It just keeps flying, free.
(AFTER A WHILE)
It was around 1:30 in the night, and I was still in the cafeteria. “Hey Allen, one cappuccino!” I called out.
“Hey, you’ve already had 12 cups,” he replied.
“What?” I looked beside me and corrected him, “Hey, it’s not 12, it’s 13. I counted!”
“Don’t you want to sleep tonight?” he asked, concerned.
“Haha,” I gave him a devilish smile and said, “Actually, Allen, I want to drink.”
“What? But why? Is it because of her?” he questioned.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
I wasn’t in my senses. For the past week, I had been surviving on just 2 hours of sleep daily because of the presentation. And yes, I had drunk these 12—oops!, 13—cups of coffee.
“I think you’re badly caffeinated. That’s why you’re talking nonsense,” Allen said.
“Hey, Allen, I’m fine. Just bring me a scotch, and I’ll be alright.”
“Have you ever drunk before?”
“No.”
“Then why now? Is it just because of a picture?”
“Hey, no, yaar. It’s because of the contract. After all, I worked so hard for it,” I replied.
“Achha, okay, I’m coming,” he said.
I wasn’t in control of myself. All I wanted was to sleep under my warm electric blanket on my cozy bed, with my soft pillow and my lonely dreams. But instead, I was doing this nonsense. I had never felt this way before. I didn’t know why it was happening. The bloody Doraemon T-shirt… I was so jealous of that Doraemon, lying on her warm chest.
“Here is your scotch,” Allen said, handing it to me.
“You actually brought it?”
I had never drunk before. I always thought I’d only drink after freeing myself from the alcoholic effect of her eyes. But today, I was finally doing it.
“By the way, Allen, why today? You always told me never to drink. Why now?” I asked, confused.
“I know this is because of her. You’ve had so many billion-dollar contracts, and you never celebrated any of them. Today’s contract wasn’t even a big one,” Allen replied.
I gave him a devilish smile and said, “Haha, you know me well.”
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
I stared at the glass for a while, thinking, So finally, this day has come. I knew I was going to regret it. I took my first sip and flinched.
“So this is what it tastes like,” I said to myself.
I wanted more until I was completely drowned in it. Soon, I fell into a deep sleep. I couldn’t even tell if I was drunk. All I felt was sleep taking over me… and her picture in my mind.
I knew I was ooverreacting but “un akho ke nashe main dubi hue dil ki halat sifr ek sharabi hi janta hain”.
I was in a daze, trying to sleep, but Allen was talking to Ankita. Even though I wanted to sleep, it wasn’t coming to me, thanks to the 12 cups of coffee—oops, 13. It was already 3 in the night, and my body was shivering with cold.
“Hey Allen, is the alcohol very low in concentration?” I asked him, feeling like I was half-conscious.
“Why?” he replied.
“Because I’m still in full control, and I can hear you properly,” I said.
He laughed softly, “Haha.”
“What? What happened? By the way, what is Ankita saying?” I asked curiously.
“Nothing, she just wants some party arrangements,” Allen said.
“But why? Am I going to be a mama? Haha!” I laughed like someone fully drunk. We both laughed together.
“Hey, don’t tell her I’ve had alcohol. She’ll kill me!” I warned him.
“Hmm, okay,” he agreed.
I wasn’t fully in my senses, and my head was pounding. But it wasn’t because of the alcohol—my smell was fine, and my tongue wasn’t dry, which usually happens after drinking a lot. Somehow, I managed to get to my room, which was in the office building.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
There were VIP rooms for the chiefs to stay if needed. I stumbled into my personal VIP room, barely able to walk. Allen helped me get there. I wanted to take a bath, but I couldn’t even change my clothes.
After falling onto my bed, I felt a silent whisper in my ear: “Sleep for her, so that you can see.”
“GOOD MORNING”
Buzz, buzz, buzz… my smartwatch was desperately trying to wake me up. My head felt like a heavy rock, and I couldn’t even lift it off the pillow. “Ahh, those 12 cups,” I muttered, forcing myself halfway up from the bed. “13,” a voice corrected me.
“Oh, sorry, 13, yes,” I replied, realizing Ankita was sitting right in front of me. At that moment, I wanted to kill Allen. It felt like I was the one about to be killed.
“What’s the time, brother?” she asked, serious this time, her tone unlike anything I’d heard before. I couldn’t tell if she was concerned or something else. Struggling to focus, I looked at my watch. It was 5:30.
“Hey, I only slept for two hours. I think it’s because of the scotch,” I said, rubbing my temples.
“It’s PM, you idiot! And you didn’t drink any scotch—that was Red Bull! I told Allen you wouldn’t handle it.”
“What?” My brain struggled to process what she was saying. “Are you serious? My first drink was fake?”
“Yes. Congratulations,” she replied, clearly unimpressed.
I felt like a complete fool. But there was something in Ankita’s expression—she looked emotional. Why?
“What happened to you?” I asked, confused.
“First, tell me this. Did you arrange all of this?” She had caught me. I didn’t want to admit it, but I told her the truth.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
“I didn’t do anything. I just gave my requirements. It’s purely a coincidence that we’re meeting again. I didn’t even know about the interviews until Kunal informed me after the final selection.”
“So, you had the chance to disqualify her. Why didn’t you?” she asked, clearly frustrated.
“Are you crazy? Why would I? She’s good at what she does and deserves the opportunity.”
“Oh really?” she said sarcastically, clearly not convinced.
I was at a loss for words. “Yes. Now, go to your fiancé’s cabin and let me get freshened up,” I said, still in yesterday’s outfit.
“Hey, do you know where she lives?” I asked Ankita.
“I don’t know,” she replied quickly.
“I know you do. Just send me the address on WhatsApp.”
“But why?”
“Wait for me and get ready. We’re going somewhere,” I told her. Truth be told, I had no idea what I was about to do or whether it was the right thing. But at this point, I had nothing to lose and nothing to gain, so I decided to take the risk.
I quickly got ready in my usual coat and pant outfit. Whenever I looked in the mirror, I felt like Jiya had changed everything about me. I wanted to thank her, but...
I called Ankita, “Where are you?”
“I’m at the front gate, but first, tell me where—”
Before she could finish, I disconnected the call. I knew that if she found out, she wouldn’t come along.
“Can you tell me now?” she asked as I shifted the car into fourth gear.
“Jiya’s home,” I said firmly.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
She muttered, “This crazy Majnu, I knew it.”
I put on my aviators, and a wave of goosebumps ran through me. I was about to do something crazy. I packed everything I needed for her surprise, even though I knew I didn’t have the right to do this. It was just another way to say sorry.
“But tell me first, why are we going there?” Ankita asked. “I don’t know,” I replied. “Then what about all the decoration items?” “Haha,” I gave her my devilish smile.
“Anki, you know she has suffered a lot. She was all alone when her parents left her, and I feel guilty for not being there for her because of our rivalry. I’m still in the competition, but this is her victory, not mine. She deserves to celebrate it, even though we both know she hates celebrations.”
Ankita was silent for a moment, realizing what I felt. “So you’re going to surprise her, even though she can’t stand to look at you and hates your face?” she said. She was right. I nodded with my head tilted slightly.
My wounded heart just wants some of her touch. It feels like it's bleeding and screaming, as if I am the only person left in the world. I yearn to escape this desolate street, where darkness reigns as king and silence sits as queen, casting shadows of fear all around me. My tears are gone now, leaving behind only regret. I don’t want anything—just one peaceful goodbye from her, and…
"Hey, I’m asking you something, idiot!"
I came back to reality from my world of regret. "Sorry, what did you say?"
"Where did you get her address?"
"Are you dumb? Who hired you in this company? I got it from her biodata, you fool!"
I was already irritated because of her silly question.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Ohk fine, how far?" she asked again. I was lost in my thoughts. I was finally going to meet her, talk to her, and congratulate her. I had planned everything.
This time, I heard her question clearly: "How far?" I looked at the road ahead while driving smoothly on the highway.
"As far as the universe," I replied, trying to sound poetic.
"Be serious," she said.
Serious? That word! It’s the main reason for my current state. Someone once told me to be serious about studies, but no one told me not to take your first love too seriously—because it’s always incomplete, no one.
The realization came too late. It wasn’t like I had never been in situationships before—I tried my best to escape the mess, but all my efforts went in vain. Yes, I gave it my all, and I…!!!
“Kunal calling,” my car’s AI assistant beeped.
“Where are you?” he asked. “In the car,” I replied simply. “I mean, where are you going?” he sounds irriteded. “To a meeting.” “Which one?” “The meeting of death.” “Oh, fine. Is Ankita with you?” “Yes. Hey Kunal, listen—don’t disturb me or Ankita for the next six hours. Cancel all meetings and keep it private.” “Don’t tell me you’re going there.” “You’re smart. Okay, bye. See you.” “But...!” Before he could say anything else, I disconnected the call.
“Switch off your phone,” I said to Ankita in a harsh tone. “What? But why?” she asked, confused. “Just do it.”
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
We were almost there, but I wasn’t feeling good. We stopped in front of her apartment, and my eyes were darting around like a spy trying to catch even the slightest movement of his target.
“This isn’t a good idea. It’s foolish,” Ankita said nervously.
I was more nervous than her. “Why are you overthinking? I’m the MD of the company she’s joining tomorrow. I’m with you, and you two were good friends once, weren’t you?”
“I remember that, but does she?” Ankita asked.
“Do you know a thing?” I said. “What?” “You’re really good at acting.”
I knew Ankita had talked to her last night when she was online—Kunal had already informed me. I just wanted to see Ankita’s surprised expression.
“Acting? Who?” she asked, trying to play innocent. “Oh, shut up and go check who’s with her, so I can order food from the hotel.”
Just then, Allen knocked on my car window. I had told him to handle all the arrangements for her surprise since he’s the best at these things.
“Now go and check,” I told Ankita.
(AFTER A WHILE)
Imagine this: you are waiting in front of the house of a girl you haven’t seen in 10 years. Back then, she avoided you because she didn’t like you, and you never understood why. Even though she hurt you with her actions, sometimes intentionally, you still loved her silently. She never had a clue about your feelings. Terrifying, isn’t it? But this isn’t my story alone; it’s the story of every one-sided true lover. For most, it fades with time, but not for me. Never for me.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
“Ankita is calling,” Allen said. “Hmm,” I replied quietly, unsure of what to say but hoping for something good. “She’s not at home,” Ankita said with a hint of relief. “Oh, okay. I’m coming,” I replied. “But why?” she asked, but I disconnected the call.
I didn’t know how to feel. Should I be happy that I wouldn’t face her? Or sad that I couldn’t see the person I love? Still, I went upstairs with Allen, carrying everything we had arranged.
“Knock knock.” The door opened, and her grandmother stood in front of me. Before she could say anything, I touched her feet for blessings and bowed down. “God bless you, son. Who are you?” she asked. “Grandma, he is with me, my brother,” Ankita introduced me, just as we had planned.
"Grandma, actually I’m here to surprise Jiya. She’s my childhood friend, and Ankita told me she recently got a very rare job." "Oh, good, good," Grandma said. Her warm gesture comforted me.
She kept looking at me for a long time. I smiled and asked, "What happened, Grandma?" "Nothing," she said. "You look like someone who was very close to me, someone very special." "Oh really? Who is he?" I asked.
It seemed like she was lost in her past. I noticed a sparkle in her eyes, one that carried both regret and guilt. I wanted to hear her story, to experience her memories. But before she could say more, Ankita shook her shoulder. "Grandma, Grandma! Actually, we’re getting late. Can we start our arrangements?" Ankita said. "Oh, sorry, sure, sure," Grandma replied, her voice heavy, almost as if she wanted to cry. But why?
"Listen, just finish it fast before Jiya arrives, and Kunal is waiting for me," Ankita said. "Okay, okay, let’s do it," I replied.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
I worked with all my heart, decorating everything beautifully, though nothing could compare to her beauty. It took me about 1.5 hours, and it felt like another success as a lover. Ankita and Allen gave their best too. As I looked at them, I felt grateful. Friends like these are a blessing—thank you, God.
After we finished, Ankita was eager to leave, worried that Jiya might come back any moment. "Okay, Grandma, we should leave now. See you soon," Ankita said. "Okay, Ankita, come again," Grandma replied.
As we prepared to leave, Grandma asked, "By the way, what’s your name, son?" I smiled, touched her feet, and replied, "Oh, Grandma, see you! By the way, who is your special one?"
Grandma started, "It’s a long story from when I was young—" but before she could finish, Ankita pulled me away. "Go and start the car. We don’t have time for Grandma’s love story," Ankita joked.
"Grandma, don’t mind. He’s a good listener. If you start now, he might end up writing a book about you," Ankita teased. "What? Really, you write books?" Grandma asked me. "Sometimes," I replied with a smile.
"I love reading, but I’ve never tried writing. Can you help me?" she asked. "Why not? Sure, Grandma," I said. "Okay, then come again, and we’ll talk more," Grandma said warmly. "Sure, see you, Grandma," I said and headed towards the car.
While Ankita stayed back to talk to Grandma, I went to get the car but had something else in mind. I wanted to surprise Ankita. I had been working on a plan for a week, actually Kunal’s idea, to thank Ankita for always helping us.
Instead of picking them up, I booked a cab for Ankita and Allen. When Ankita called me, angry, she said, "Hey, where are you, idiot?"
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Don’t worry. I’ve booked a cab for you. It’s on its way. Give the phone to Allen," I replied calmly.
I quickly explained the surprise plan to Allen. The surprise was about Ankita’s parents. She hadn’t met them in two years because of her work, and they were also busy with their business. But with Kunal’s help, we managed to arrange this special reunion.
Kunal and I were waiting for her call at the cafeteria in City Center. We knew she was coming, and today wasn’t just any day—it was their unofficial ring ceremony.
"Hey, where are the rings?" Kunal asked me nervously.
"They’ll be in your hands when you propose to her," I replied. Although they were already committed, the proposal itself felt special, more meaningful than any gift. Everything was ready; we were just waiting for Ankita. We had even booked all the tables to ensure nothing came in the way of Kunal's big moment.
Kunal looked nervous, and I couldn’t understand why. They had been in a relationship for the past 10 years, and both their families approved of them. So, what was the problem?
"Why are you so nervous?" I asked him.
"Will she say yes?" he muttered hesitantly.
I burst out laughing. "Are you serious? Of course, she will! Don’t worry," I assured him. "And honestly, do you think she’d ever find a guy like you? She’s so lucky to have you, yaar."
"Hope so," he said with a shy smile.
As I expected, she said yes. I was sitting about six tables away from their table, recording their memorable moment on video. While watching them, I felt... nothing. It was like there was nothing left in my life. Everything seemed to be going really well, or was it?
I thought they needed some privacy, so I stood up and went to the first floor to get something for them as a gift. That’s when I
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
remembered I hadn’t eaten anything the entire day. My stomach growled, almost yelling, “What are you doing, idiot?”
I walked into the Gucci store to check out some watches. All three of us—me, her, and him—were fond of watches. "Hi sir, how are you?" the manager greeted me. He knew me well since I often visited the shop. Not for myself, but for my clients, who also gave me return gifts.
"Do you have a watch set for couples?" I asked.
"Oh yes, sir, we do. Is it for bhabhi?" he asked with a teasing smile. I just smiled shyly without saying anything.
Suddenly, Kunal called me. "Hello! Where are you? Ankita is looking for you."
"I'm on the first floor. I'll be there in a minute," I replied.
"She went looking for you. She was crying when I told her about the surprise we planned."
"Are you serious? But why? It’s not such a big thing," I said, surprised.
"Sir, your order is ready," the manager interrupted.
"Oh, okay. I’m coming. Where is she now?"
"She went to the first floor."
"What?! Okay, I’ll find her," I said, grabbing the watches and rushing out of the store.
While checking my phone, I noticed hundreds of emails and messages. I sighed, realizing, “Tomorrow’s going to be a busy day.”

WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"What are you doing? Are you an idiot?" the supervisor shouted at me.
"What happened, sir?" one of my colleagues interrupted.
"Ask her what she did! She deleted all my presentations!"
"What?! But why?"
"Sorry, sir. It was an accident. I am really sorry!" I apologized.
"What will I do with your sorry? How could you be so careless with such important work? And who even hired you, huh?" he scolded me, almost making me cry. Everyone was staring at me with angry eyes, and I was standing there blankly, my heart full of regret.
"Wait, I will take this to the MD!"
"What?! No, sir! I will make the presentations again. Please don't take this to him, sir," I begged, as it was my first day and I didn’t want to face the MD for my mistake.
"I am calling him!"
Suddenly, my sleepy eyes opened with the chirping sound of my grandma's voice, "Jiu, Jiu."
"Umm, good morning, Grandma," I said in a sleepy voice.
"Are you all right? Did you have a bad dream?" she guessed correctly.
"Yes, kind of," I replied.
"Okay, don't worry. Get up, take a bath, and get ready. Grandpa wants to go with you."
"Oh, okay. But why? I am not a kid anymore!," I said, trying to act grown-up, but I was actually happy to have his company.
I grabbed my bathrobe and went into the bathroom. It wasn’t even cold for me, but my careful Bubu always made sure to get me a bucket of hot water, even though there was a geyser. I switched on
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
the shower, and the very first drop of water that splashed on my skin felt like heaven. This is the moment every girl dreams of – ah, this cozy shower! As each drop touched me, it felt like it was searching for my soul, flowing down to the earth beneath and turning into droplets of heaven.
While enjoying the shower, the face of my supervisor suddenly came to my mind. That dream had really disturbed me. I knew things wouldn’t go the way I feared, but I had to be prepared, as always. I knew I could handle such situations easily, but what about him? If he caught me making a mistake, he wouldn’t miss the chance to embarrass me. Every move of my hand as I washed my body reminded me of him – but why? And what if he really found me doing something wrong? What would I do? He was so selfish and arrogant, sine i knew him. How did he even become the MD, yaar?
Obviously, he worked hard, but I don’t want to get too close to him. He’s just my superior, nothing more, even though he seems to like me. But does he really like me? Why would he, huh? After all, he has a good status now. Why would he even think about me, right? But… what if he does? No, no, that’s impossible. He doesn’t. And even if he does, what’s the big deal? He’s just my superior, that’s all. I have to—
"Jiu, I pressed your dress. Come fast! Breakfast is on the table," Grandma shouted from outside the bathroom.
"Okay, Bubu," I replied, suddenly realizing I was still in the bathroom, lost in my thoughts about my favorite rival.
(AFTER THE BATH)
Opening the door and tightening my white bathrobe, I saw everything was already prepared—it really felt like a princess treatment. As I dried my wet, smelly hair, my skin craved its daily skincare routine. I don’t like using makeup or other cosmetics, but yes, I love myself, so I take care of it. I sat in front of my dressing table, where all my skincare items were neatly placed. Even though it was cold, my lips felt rosy because I love them—yes, I love myself.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
I muttered to myself, “Some toner... mmm... now some serum... mmm... okay, some moisturizer. Perfect, as always.” Then I peeked out from behind the curtains. “Oh, thank God, just a little sun.” I finished with sunscreen—the last but not the least.
But why was I so happy? I should’ve been nervous and anxious. Why was I feeling like this? It wasn’t normal. Was it because of him? No, it wasn’t that. It was his personality. I remembered him from school—his presence always made everyone feel safe. Every girl trusted him, and so did I. I remember when we were in a quiz competition together—I felt like no one could beat us. Parents trusted him, even mine.
But then, nostalgia hit me, followed by guilt and regret. These emotions overwhelmed me, and my eyes filled with tears. Anger started building up like a rock in my heart.
“Jiu, Jiu, your breakfast is getting cold,” Grandma called out. I quickly wiped my face to hide my tears, but it was in vain. Bubu, caught me.
“Mom and Dad, right?” she asked softly.
“Yes,” I replied in a childlike voice. She hugged me, placing my head on her belly. That hug felt so warm and comforting—it reminded me of them even more. A peaceful silence surrounded us, and I wanted nothing else at that moment. I wanted to freeze time and stay there forever.
But then, I remembered the supervisor’s face and snapped out of it. I got up from the cozy hug. The breakfast looked divine, but my excitement had taken away my appetite. I took just a few bites and got ready in my new dress—well, it was yesterday’s dress.
Grandpa was waiting for me in his car. It had just come back from the service center and looked brand new. Both Grandpa and I are die-hard car fans. He loves Mercedes, and so do I. Taking blessings from my sweet Bubu, I left my room—the last free space of my life. From tomorrow, I’d be someone new, and this room would hold a new version of Jiya.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
(IN THE CAR)
"We should leave now," Grandpa said. "Yeah, we should," I replied with a silly smile.
The distance wasn't very long, but my feelings were anxious and mixed. I wasn't overly nervous or excited, though—it wasn't the first time I was going to work somewhere.
"Did you discuss your salary?" Grandpa asked, interrupting the silence.
"I haven't yet. I think they will let me after seeing my performance at work," I said.
"Okay, that's also good," Grandpa replied.
It seemed like he wanted to say something more, but something was holding him back. He drove silently, with a humble calmness. At that moment, I realized that silence can feel heavenly when you're with your loved ones, but if it carries unspoken words or feelings, it can hurt. The same silence that feels like heaven can turn into hell. That's how I felt now.
We were almost there. The main gate looked like a military base camp—huge, so huge. After reaching the gate, we found that outsiders were prohibited, and only authorized vehicles were allowed inside the office campus.
"Sir, sorry, you have to leave your car here," the security guard said. "Okay," Grandpa replied humbly. "Pa, I’ll go from here," I said. "Okay, but is this a military camp or a private company?" he asked playfully. I laughed. "Okay, see you, Pa," I said, hugging him tightly before leaving.
I got out of the car, and he drove away softly through the exit. My eyes stayed fixed on him until he completely disappeared from sight.
"Uff, finally," I sighed, looking around the company campus. There was everything you could imagine. But I didn’t have much time to
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
explore. I quickly walked towards the office campus through the first entrance, then headed to the main building entrance.
"Is this a 5-star hotel or a company building?" I wondered. Everything was made of pure crystal glass, even the main gate, which was automatic too. I couldn’t help but think about the architect’s genius—how could a human being create something like this?
As I entered the building, a fresh, sweet, heavenly fragrance hit me. It was amazing, instantly making me feel refreshed and relaxed. I was momentarily stuck, forgetting where I was and what I was doing. The silence was so pure, and everyone around me was working perfectly, as if they were masters of their craft.
"Hi, ma’am," came a sweet voice out of nowhere. A beautiful, young girl, probably younger than me, greeted me with a flower bouquet. When I looked around, I realized she wasn’t alone. "Hi, ma’am, welcome to EG," they all said in unison. "Thank you so much," I replied. "Thank you for joining us, ma’am," they said, smiling warmly as if they already knew me. "The pleasure is all mine," I said.
"Mam, I’m Netra, your PA," said the first girl who greeted me. I was shocked by this special treatment. Why was I being treated like royalty? Was I here for some prestigious work or something? "Hi, Netra. So, you’re my eyes, just like your name, haha," I joked with a silly smile, trying to show confidence.
Everyone started introducing themselves: "Hi, ma’am, I’m Rocky." "I’m Kaushik." "I’m Priya." "I’m Divya."……..
….
……
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
…. And then, "I’m Ritik," came a name I hated the most.
The moment I heard it, I asked, "Are you the MD?" Everyone stared at me like I’d committed a crime. "Really? Haven’t you ever seen our MD?" they asked, as if he were a celebrity. "No way, is he a celebrity?" I replied with an attitude. "No, I mean, there’s no comparison between our Ritik Sir and this langoor," Netra said, concerned. "Oh, why? Is he so handsome?" I asked, pretending I didn’t already know about him. Everyone burst into laughter.
"Hahaha, you’ll know when you see him," they said. "Okay, fine, I’ll see," I replied casually.
Everyone started talking about something I didn’t quite catch. I didn’t want to mess up on my first day, so I changed the topic. "Okay, guys, should we get to work? Can someone tell me about my responsibilities?" I asked. "Oh, sorry, ma’am, come with me," Netra said, leading the way. "Wait, one thing. Please don’t call me ma’am. Call me Jiya. I don’t like being called ma’am. Everyone, please call me Jiya," I announced to the group.
"Okay, guys, see you later," I said as Netra guided me to my workspace.
The elevator was quite large, similar to those in hospitals. I was truly amazed by its interiors as I had never seen anything like them before. It looked as though every tiny detail had been crafted with perfection.
"Netra, where is the MD's cabin?" I didn’t want to ask but ended up asking anyway. "It's on the 25th floor, but..." she stopped mid-sentence. "But what?" I inquired. "Actually, he recently requested to move his cabin to the topmost floor, the 30th," she said. "Oh, but why? Didn't anyone ask him?" I asked again. "We did, but he said he feels unwelcome there. The strange thing is
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
that he's been using that cabin for almost three years without any issue. So why now?" she replied, sounding confused. "Oh, by the way, where is my cabin?" "It's on the 25th floor," she said. I started to get an idea of why he shifted. Could it be because of me? Did he move because I was coming? Maybe. But why would he? Am I a monster to him?
"Ma’am! Ma’am! We've reached," Netra said, breaking my train of thought while I was still standing in the elevator. "Door closing," the elevator announced. My reaction was too slow, and I missed getting out. I quickly pressed the button for the 25th floor, but someone had already pressed the button from the 30th floor. "Oh no, not this," I muttered in frustration. Just then, I received a notification. Pop-pop It was a message from Netra: "Ma’am, I am waiting." She was still calling me "ma’am"—what a well-mannered girl.
"Door opening," the elevator announced again. This was not good. I took out my phone and pretended to be busy because, in that very second, I sensed it. My rival was standing there. However, he seemed equally preoccupied with his phone and didn’t glance anywhere while entering the elevator. "Thank God," I thought to myself. He seemed very focused on his phone. I was amazed. "What is he doing? Is he chatting with someone?" I muttered under my breath. I tried to peep into his phone, but his hands were quite tall. He smelled excellent—what perfume does he use?
"Door opening," the elevator announced again. "Good morning, sir," Netra greeted him. "Oh, Netra! Morning," he replied. I somehow managed to avoid him and slipped out of the elevator quietly, like a thief. "Just missed," I murmured to myself. "What, ma’am? What did you miss?" Netra asked, overhearing my words. "Oh, nothing. Where’s my cabin?" I said, trying to change the topic. "This way, ma’am," she said, leading me.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
The corridor was quite long, and it took almost three minutes to walk through it. "Ma’am, this is your cabin," Netra pointed out. The door had the words Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) glowing on it. I was quite shocked because this wasn’t a small post at all, and no one had mentioned it to me earlier. I immediately felt the weight of responsibility settling on my shoulders. "Oh, nice. Thank you," I said, pretending as if it was not a big deal.
The table in the cabin was truly beautiful, and the cabin itself was huge, with all the necessary facilities. But my attention was completely drawn to the table. It had a stunning globe, a miniature model of the company campus, a table lamp, a pen stand, and more. As I was admiring the table, I heard a voice: "Hi, Jiya, welcome."
I turned to see the HR and his team entering my cabin and greeting me warmly.
"Oh, sir, thank you! It's my pleasure to have this opportunity," I responded confidently.
"I hope we’ll do a great job together," he said.
"Sure, sir! I’ll do my best to make you and the company proud," I replied, speaking with enthusiasm.
The HR looked quite young, almost my age. I didn’t have the courage to ask him his date of birth, though the thought crossed my mind.
"Sir, Ritik sir is calling," one of his team members informed him. I thought to myself, Why is his timing always so perfect?
"Yes, Ritik, I’ll be there in 5 minutes. Okay, see you," he said, surprising me. I wondered why an HR was addressing the MD by his name. Strange, I thought.
"Okay, Jiya, we’ll meet soon. Netra, give her all the instructions and facilities," he told Netra before leaving the room. My curiosity couldn’t hold back any longer.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Hey Netra, why does he call the MD by his name?" I asked once he left the cabin.
"Actually," Netra explained, "the HR and the MD were college friends, so he often calls him by his name. But in formal settings, like business meetings, he addresses him as 'Sir'."
That explained it. I was right-he is probably the same age as me.
"Ma’am, can we start?" Netra asked, ready to guide me through my work.
"Yes, sure," I replied.
"This is the management building, this is the sports club, and this is the auditorium..." she began, introducing me to the campus. To my surprise, the campus was fully equipped with excellent facilities.
It took nearly three hours to understand my responsibilities, but I found the work quite interesting.
"Knock, knock," someone interrupted while Netra was explaining.
"Ma’am, Kunal sir asked me to deliver this," said a boy who didn’t look Indian.
"Oh, but why you, Allen?" Netra asked.
"Actually, everyone else was busy, so I..." His expression seemed a bit off.
"Okay, thanks. Keep it on the table. By the way, Maam is our new CMO, Jiya. Jiya, this is Allen, the chief chef," Netra introduced us.
Allen stared at me in a way that made me uncomfortable, almost like a pervert. However, he left silently, and Netra continued explaining my duties.
“FULL-TIME”
"Pa, where are you?" I called out to Grandpa after experiencing the first day of my office.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"In front of the exit gate," Grandpa replied, man of time.
The day was good, not very exciting, but it passed with new learnings. Thank God I didn’t encounter him—phew! I was alone in my cabin as Netra had gone to grab a coffee, being the coffee lover she is. She returned while I was packing up my things.
"Ma’am, did you open the box?" she asked.
I had completely forgotten about it. I opened the box, and inside were some daily-use items, like a company-branded bottle, pen, diary, a T-shirt, and a few other things. There was also a watch, which had no engraving on it, but it looked beautiful and quite expensive.
"Ma’am, here are your keys," Netra said, handing me a pair of keys that looked like car keys with the Mercedes logo.
"What is this?" I asked.
"Oh, I forgot to tell you! Actually, every senior-level employee gets an office car. These are the keys," she explained.
I was surprised, though I knew about this facility. I paused for a moment to think and then said with a smile, "Thank you, but I love going with my Grandpa. So, not now. You keep the keys with you, and whenever I want it, I’ll ask you. Okay?"
"Okay, as you wish. But don’t hesitate to ask me," she said politely.
The real reason I declined was that I wanted to buy a car with my own money. If Grandpa found out about this car, he would never let me purchase one on my own—his business mind at work!
"Okay, Ma’am. See you tomorrow," Netra greeted as she left.
The timing at the office was great. There wasn’t a fixed time to leave; you could go home whenever your work was done. I don’t think I could ask for anything better!
“GRANDPA ME AND HOME”
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"How was your first day, Jiu?" Pa asked me. "Not very interesting," I replied.
I was feeling content, like I had everything I ever wanted. Closing my eyes and resting my head on the seat's headrest, I started dreaming about my future.
"Actually, Jiu, we are leaving tomorrow," he said.
This was the moment I hated the most. When life feels perfect, God suddenly decides to test you. Why does He do this? I felt anger rising inside me. "I hate you, God. I hate you the most."
Now I understood why Pa had been so quiet all day.
"But why?" I asked, my jaw dropping in disbelief. My happiness sank to a negative point.
"Don’t worry, Jiu. Very soon, I’m planning to sell my business, and your grandma and I will shift here with you. I’ve already checked out a property nearby," he said, trying to comfort me.
"But when? After how many years or decades?" I asked angrily.
"After a month," he replied.
I felt a bit relieved. "Phew," I thought. But then the worry came rushing back—how would I survive this one month alone?
"Okay, then do one thing," I said firmly. "Leave Bubu with me, and you go and finish your work. I know you can manage on your own."
"But..." he hesitated.
"No 'but.' Just for me," I insisted.
He started thinking and finally said, "Okay, fine."
“HEART BREAK”
I wasn’t feeling good about separating these two lovers. I knew they couldn’t live without each other, but it was just for a month, so I told myself it would be okay. We reached home after being bathed
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
in the orange rays of the setting sun. As I opened the door to my flat, I saw exactly what I had expected—Bubu was busy packing her things. I went inside and hugged her from behind. Heavy drops of tears began falling from all four eyes. Everyone was drenched in their ocean of sorrow. "You are not going anywhere. I want you here," I said, my voice trembling with emotion.
When you have nothing, your heart becomes like a stone because it doesn't matter what you have or don't have. But when you have something very important to you, the heart starts fearing loss or heartbreak. I was too afraid of losing what mattered to me.
“WHAT IF?”
"Jiu, Jiu, wake up! Don’t you want to have dinner today?" Bubu called out to me as I was lost in my ocean of desires, drifting off to sleep. I felt destroyed, scattered, and completely defeated. Yes, I was overthinking again, but I was relieved that Bubu wasn’t going anywhere.
"Oh, what’s the time?" I asked Grandma in a sleepy voice.
"It’s 9. Get up! Kabya called you several times. I didn’t pick up—I think it’s something urgent," she replied.
"Okay, I’ll call her. Can you bring me a glass of water? I’m so thirsty," I asked out of habit. I glanced at my phone and noticed not just Kabya but Netra had also called me several times. Now, I was curious.
I called Kabya first.
"Hey, where are you?" she asked urgently, sounding like she was in a hurry.
"I was sleeping, yaar. Tell me, what happened?" I replied.
"Why haven’t you watched the news?" she asked.
"Why should I? What happened? Stop making suspense and just tell me in one line," I said, frustrated.
WHAT IF? THE OCEAN OF DESIRES
"Ritik..." she said and stopped. Her voice dropped.
"What happened to him? Did he die?" I joked with a silly laugh.
"Yes," she said, her voice almost soundless.
"Are you kidding me?" I asked.
"I’m serious," she replied.
I jumped out of bed and ran to the hall, where Grandpa was watching the news. The anchor was saying, "Here’s the big breaking news: the Managing Director of the most valuable company died this evening in a car accident. His body has not been found yet; his car sank in the river."
At that moment, it felt as if my ocean of desires had dried up completely. What if I meet you again?
